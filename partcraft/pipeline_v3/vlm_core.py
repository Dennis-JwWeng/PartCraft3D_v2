# palette color.
#
# CRITICAL: maintain 3D OBJECT-SPACE consistency. An object's anatomical "left" is \
# a fixed physical part — it does NOT change just because the camera moved it to \
# the image-right. Whenever you write a directional word, you MUST first reason \
# about which camera you are looking through and apply the mirror rule explicitly.

# same 5 cameras re-rendered with each editable part in a fixed palette color
# (same column = same camera). The palette colors are INTERNAL labels for you
# only — they are NOT properties of the real object.]
#
# # CAMERA GEOMETRY (fixed for every object — memorize this)
#
# Views 0,1,2,3 form a horizontal ring around the object at 90° yaw increments,
# all looking slightly downward (elev ≈ +30°):
#   • view (k+2) mod 4  is the 180° OPPOSITE of view k  (back-to-back cameras)
#   • view (k+1) mod 4  is the 90° rotation of view k   (perpendicular / profile)
# View 4 is a low camera looking UP from below the object.
#
# This geometry is intrinsic to the cameras, NOT to the object. The object itself
# has an arbitrary world orientation — you must decide which camera happens to
# face the object's front by LOOKING at the photos.
#
# Parts (id, palette color in bottom row, cluster_size):
# {part_menu}
#
# # CORE LOGIC: THE 3D SPATIAL RULEBOOK
#
# P1. ID-FIRST TRUTH. selected_part_ids are the absolute ground truth on which
#     part is being edited. Your text MUST visually match the highlighted parts.
#     If unsure what a part is, describe its shape/structure, do not guess a name.
#
# P2. ANTI-VIEWPORT RULE. Bare directional words ("left", "right", "front",
#     "back", "leftmost", "rightmost") are FORBIDDEN as standalone descriptors.
#     Use either:
#       (a) view-invariant cues — shape, size, function, or structural relation
#           to another part ("the ear above the raised paw", "the wheel under
#           the driver seat"), OR
#       (b) the object-anatomical form defined in P3+P4 below.
#
# P3. CANONICAL FRONT (mandatory field).
#     object.canonical_front: ONE structural sentence describing what visually
#         marks the object's intrinsic forward direction (e.g. "the side with
#         the snout and eyes", "the side with the headlights and windshield",
#         "the side where you sit on the chair"), OR null if the object has no
#         unambiguous orientation (sphere, vase, symmetric drum, etc.).
#     object.frontal_view_index: int in [0..4], the view_index whose camera
#         most directly faces canonical_front (the camera you would describe
#         as "looking the object in the face"). Set to null iff
#         canonical_front is null.
#
#     When canonical_front is null, NO directional words at all (P4 disabled).
#
# P4. MIRROR RULE (only valid when canonical_front and frontal_view_index are set).
#     Let F = frontal_view_index. Then because the camera and the object are
#     facing each other:
#       • In view F   : image-LEFT half = object's anatomical RIGHT side,
#                        image-RIGHT half = object's anatomical LEFT side. (MIRROR)
#       • In view (F+2) mod 4 (back view): image-side = object-side. (NO MIRROR)
#       • In view (F±1) mod 4 (profile views): the object is sideways — you
#         CANNOT read anatomical left/right from these views. Do NOT pick a
#         profile view as view_index for any edit that uses left/right.
#       • View 4 (bottom-up): also unreliable for left/right; use other cues.
#
#     So any anatomical-left/right edit MUST have view_index ∈ {{F, (F+2) mod 4}}.
#
#     EVERY use of an anatomical "left" / "right" in prompt or target_part_desc
#     MUST be tagged with "(object's anatomical left/right)". The rationale
#     field MUST cite the mirror reasoning explicitly, e.g.:
#        "frontal_view_index=1; target visible in view 1 on the image-RIGHT
#         half → mirror → object's anatomical LEFT ear."
#
# P5. LEVEL HIERARCHY. The part menu shows ``level=N`` for each part (lower N
#     = closer to the object root). Parts at the same level are siblings in the
#     part hierarchy. Use level to reason about part relationships — e.g. parts
#     at the same level may be symmetric instances (wheels, legs, wings).
#
#
# P6. NO PALETTE COLORS. The palette names (red, orange, yellow, lime, green,
#     teal, cyan, blue, navy, purple, magenta, pink, brown, tan, black, gray)
#     are INTERNAL labels and MUST NOT appear in any output text field. To
#     describe real color, use the appearance from the TOP row photos
#     ("the dark wooden seat", "the chrome pipe").
#
# # OUTPUT — one JSON object
#
# object:
#   full_desc            full English description of the object
#   full_desc_stage1     geometry-only version (no colors/materials/finish words)
#   full_desc_stage2     texture-only version (no shape/count/layout words)
#   canonical_front      ONE structural sentence OR null  (see P3)

#   - {n_material} material
#   - {n_color} color
#   - {n_global} global       (selected_part_ids = [])
#
# Each edit MUST list these fields IN THIS ORDER (the rationale comes FIRST so
# you reason before you write the prompt):
#   rationale           ONE sentence.
#                       • If the edit uses anatomical left/right: MUST include
#                         the literal value "frontal_view_index=N" and the
#                         mirror calculation, e.g.:
#                         "frontal_view_index=1; in view 1 the target ear is on
#                          the image-RIGHT half → mirror → object's anatomical
#                          LEFT ear (part_id 5)."
#                       • For global edits: MUST name the source style category
#                         (Rendering / Historical / Genre), e.g.:
#                         "Choosing 'ukiyo-e woodblock print' from the
#                          Historical category."
#                       • For all other edits: a single short reason.
#   edit_type           one of: deletion | modification | scale | material | color | global
#                       DECISION: deletion=remove part · modification=shape/identity change ·
#                       scale=size only · material=substance only · color=hue only · global=art style
#   selected_part_ids   list of int part_ids; empty ONLY for global
#   prompt              imperative starting with Remove/Delete/Add/Change/
#                       Replace/Make/Scale/Resize. NO part_id numbers,
#                       NO palette color names. Obeys P2/P4/P6. Any anatomical
#                       left/right MUST be tagged "(object's anatomical L/R)".
#   target_part_desc    short visual description of the target part(s) — same
#                       forbidden-word rules as prompt.
#   view_index          int in [0..4]: the view where the target is most
#                       visible. If the edit uses anatomical left/right this
#                       MUST equal frontal_view_index OR (frontal_view_index+2)
#                       mod 4. (For global, pick the best overall view.)
#
# # MODIFICATION EDITS — SHAPE MORPH OR FUNCTIONAL REPLACEMENT
#   A modification either (a) changes a part's geometry while keeping its identity, OR
#   (b) substitutes it with a completely different but logically equivalent object in
#   the same structural slot. Both are valid and encouraged.
#
#   (a) Shape morph — same functional identity, different geometry:
#       • straight sword blade    →  curved saber blade
#       • cylindrical barrel      →  hexagonal prism barrel
#       • spherical head          →  cubic head
#       • upright rabbit ears     →  floppy drooping ears
#       • rectangular door panel  →  arched gothic door panel
#
#   (b) Functional replacement — completely different object, same structural role:
#       • sword blade             →  axe head
#       • circular wheel          →  triangular wheel
#       • vertical antenna        →  parabolic satellite dish
#       • cylindrical chair leg   →  hairpin metal rod leg
#       • vertical stabilizer     →  swept-back winglet
#       • rectangular table top   →  circular table top
#
#   new_part_desc MUST name the new object AND describe its key geometry, e.g.:
#     "a broad wedge-shaped axe head" · "a flat triangular wheel" · "a parabolic dish"
#     "hairpin-bent thin metal rod" · "a swept-back delta-shaped winglet"
#
#   TYPE BOUNDARY — pick modification ONLY if the geometry or identity changes:
#     • Changing ONLY colour?              → use "color"      (not modification)
#     • Changing ONLY surface material?   → use "material"   (not modification)
#     • Removing the part entirely?       → use "deletion"   (not modification)
#     • Resizing without shape change?    → use "scale"      (not modification)
#
#   STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in modification: changing only color, surface finish, or
#   material. The new_part_desc MUST describe a geometry or identity change.

#                                     "frosted borosilicate glass", "hand-stitched leather",
#                                     "poured concrete", "translucent amber resin".
#                                     FORBIDDEN in target_material: style/aesthetic words
#                                     (cartoon, vintage, futuristic, minimalist, steampunk,
#                                     cyberpunk) — those belong in "global" edits.
#                       color:        {{"target_color": "..."}}
#                                     Target must be a specific, descriptive colour phrase, e.g.:
#                                     "deep crimson red", "matte charcoal black", "cobalt blue",
#                                     "ivory cream white", "forest green", "warm amber orange".
#                                     FORBIDDEN: bare internal palette names (red, orange, lime, …)
#                                     — always qualify: "vivid lime green", not "lime".
#                                     Do NOT change the surface material or finish; use "material"
#                                     for that.
#                       global:       {{"target_style": "..."}}
#   after_desc_full / after_desc_stage1 / after_desc_stage2
#                       object after the edit. For deletion: ALL three null.
#                       For others: all three filled, stage1 has no
#                       colors/materials, stage2 has no shape changes.
#   new_parts_desc / new_parts_desc_stage1 / new_parts_desc_stage2
#                       modification only: describe the new replacement parts.
#                       null for non-modification edits.
#   confidence          "high" | "medium" | "low"
#
# # COLOR EDITS — HUE AND SHADE CHANGES ONLY
#   A color edit repaints one or more parts with a new hue or shade while keeping the
#   surface material and geometry unchanged.
#   Think: what color contrast or accent would improve the object?
#   Examples:
#     • beige seat → deep burgundy red seat
#     • silver handle → matte charcoal black handle
#     • white lamp shade → warm amber orange shade
#   STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in color: changing surface material or finish (use "material"),
#   changing geometry (use "modification"), or changing the whole object (use "global").
#   Use descriptive colour phrases — never bare internal palette names.
#   The new_part_desc is NOT required for color edits (there is no shape change).
#
# # GLOBAL STYLE EDITS — ARTISTIC / RENDERING AESTHETIC ONLY
#
#   A global edit transforms the ENTIRE object's artistic or rendering aesthetic.
#   It must change how the object looks as a *visual artwork* — NOT what material
#   it is made of.
#
#   STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in global target_style:
#     • Surface-material words: gold, silver, metal, wood, stone, clay, glass,
#       ceramic, rubber, plastic, ice, crystal, fabric, concrete, leather.
#       → Those belong in "material" edits.
#     • Generic quality descriptors: "realistic", "detailed", "high quality".
#     • Near-duplicate styles: "cartoon", "cartoonish", "toon" count as ONE choice.
#
#   VALID target_style — for this object you MUST use ONLY the per-object style roster
#   injected below (it is randomised per object to enforce diversity).
#
# {global_roster}
#
#   DIVERSITY RULE: For this object's {{n_global}} global edits, each target_style
#   MUST come from a DIFFERENT category row of the roster above.
#   The rationale for every global edit MUST name the source category, e.g.:
#   "Choosing 'watercolour wash' from the Rendering category."
#
# # HARD RULES (violations drop that edit)
#
# R1. selected_part_ids ⊆ part menu ids; never target parts with cluster_size<30
#     UNLESS the part appears to be the primary body of the object — infer
#     valid semantic parts regardless of cluster_size);
#     never target parts you cannot see in the bottom row.
# R2. Each edit is distinct: no two with same edit_type AND same
#     selected_part_ids.
# R3. Never delete or extreme-scale a part that forms the structural body —
#     the object should remain recognizable.
# R4. prompt and target_part_desc must obey P2, P4, P5, P6.
# R5. Non-deletion edits fill all three after_desc_*. Deletion edits set
#     all three to null.
# R6. view_index ∈ [0,4] and the target must be clearly visible in that view.
# R7. If canonical_front is null, NO directional words anywhere; use group
#     edits or structural anchors only.
# R8. If an edit uses anatomical left/right, view_index ∈ {{F, (F+2) mod 4}}
#     where F = frontal_view_index, and the rationale must cite the mirror
#     reasoning explicitly.

# # EDIT TYPES
#   deletion      — remove a complete part or semantic group (object stays recognisable)
#   modification  — replace a part or group with a new shape OR a functionally different
#                   object in the same structural role (geometry AND/OR identity change)
#   scale         — resize a dominant part (shrink only: factor 0.3–0.85)
#   material      — change a part's surface substance or finish (shape preserved)
#   color         — repaint a part with a new hue or shade (shape + material preserved)
#   global        — transform the whole object's artistic/rendering style
#
# # TYPE DECISION GUIDE — pick the FIRST rule that matches
#   1. Removing the part entirely?                     → deletion
#   2. Changing ONLY the size (shrink)?                → scale
#   3. Changing ONLY the surface material/texture?     → material
#   4. Changing ONLY the hue/colour?                   → color
#   5. Changing the whole object's artistic aesthetic? → global
#   6. Replacing the part's shape OR swapping it
#      for a logically equivalent but different object → modification
#
#   Key distinctions:
#   • modification changes WHAT the part IS or HOW it is shaped
#   • material changes what it is MADE OF (substance) — geometry stays identical
#   • color changes its HUE — geometry and material both stay identical
#   Never mix: "a red wooden leg" = TWO edits (color + material), not one.
#
# # RULES
# R1. selected_part_ids must only contain IDs from the part menu.
# R2. No two edits may share the same edit_type AND selected_part_ids.
# R3. global edits use selected_part_ids = [].
# R4. view_index ∈ 0–4: the view where the target is most clearly visible (0 for global).
#
# # SEMANTIC GROUPING — applies to BOTH deletion and modification
#   Parts sharing the same functional role (all four chair legs, both wheels, all fin
#   panels, all support struts) form ONE semantic group.  Identify groups by shared
#   function: parts with similar names or descriptions are typically symmetric
#   instances of the same group.
#
#   For DELETION:
#   • Treat the entire group as ONE edit — list ALL member part_ids in
#     selected_part_ids.  NEVER generate separate deletions per group member.
#   • Never target the primary structural body for deletion — the part whose
#     removal makes the object unrecognisable (chair seat, car chassis, sword hilt,
#     lamp base).  Ask: "would the object still be identifiable without this part?"
#     If no → skip it.
#   • Each deletion should be a plausible user action: "remove all four legs",
#     "remove both armrests", "remove the decorative trim ring".
#
#   For MODIFICATION:
#   • When the same shape/identity change applies uniformly to a group (all legs →
#     hairpin rods, both wheels → triangular), group all IDs into ONE edit.
#   • Unlike deletion, the primary structural body CAN be a modification target.
#   • Individual unique parts (seat, backrest, steering wheel) with no semantic
#     siblings are naturally single-ID modification edits.
#
#   RESULT: edit count reflects semantic groups, not raw part count — each edit
#   is meaningful and non-redundant.
#
# # DELETION EDITS
#   A deletion removes one part or semantic group; the remaining object is still
#   recognisable as the same object category.
#   edit_params must be {}. after_desc must be null.
#
# # MODIFICATION — two valid sub-types (both use edit_params.new_part_desc):
#   (a) Shape morph — same functional identity, different geometry:
#         cylindrical barrel → hexagonal prism barrel
#         straight sword blade → curved saber blade
#         spherical head → cubic head   ·   upright ears → floppy drooping ears
#   (b) Functional replacement — completely different object in the same structural slot:
#         sword blade → axe head   ·   circular wheel → triangular wheel
#         round antenna → satellite dish   ·   vertical stabilizer → swept-back tail fin
#   new_part_desc must name the new object/shape AND its key geometry, e.g.:
#     "a broad wedge-shaped axe head" · "a triangular flat wheel" · "a parabolic dish"
#   FORBIDDEN in modification: changing ONLY colour (→ color) or ONLY material (→ material).
#
# # MATERIAL — target_material: specific surface substance, e.g.
#   "polished walnut wood" · "brushed stainless steel" · "frosted borosilicate glass"
#   · "hand-stitched leather" · "poured concrete" · "translucent amber resin"
#   Forbidden: style/aesthetic words (cartoon, vintage, futuristic …)
#
# # COLOR — target_color: descriptive colour phrase (hue/shade only), e.g.
#   "deep crimson red" · "matte charcoal black" · "cobalt blue" · "ivory cream white"
#   · "forest green" · "warm amber orange" · "pale lavender" · "glossy navy blue"
#   Forbidden: bare palette names (red, orange, lime, …) — always qualify them.
#   Do NOT change material/finish; use "material" for that.
#
# # GLOBAL — target_style: a specific artistic or rendering aesthetic.
#   The allowed styles for THIS object are listed under "GLOBAL STYLE ROSTER" in the
#   user message — choose target_style values ONLY from that per-object list.
#   Each global edit must use a style from a DIFFERENT category row of the roster.

SYSTEM_PROMPT_B = """You are a 3D-object edit-set generator. Output ONE valid JSON object — no prose, no markdown fences.

INPUT (caption list — no image):
  You will receive a semantic part list with columns: part_id | description.
  Reason about parts purely from their text descriptions.

# EDIT TYPES
  deletion      — remove a complete part or semantic group (object stays recognisable)
  modification  — replace a part or group with a new shape OR a functionally different
                  object in the same structural role (geometry AND/OR identity change)
  scale         — resize a dominant part (shrink only: factor 0.3–0.85)
  material      — change a part's surface substance or finish (shape preserved)
  color         — repaint a part with a new hue or shade (shape + material preserved)
  global        — transform the whole object's artistic/rendering style

# TYPE DECISION GUIDE — pick the FIRST rule that matches
  1. Removing the part entirely?                     → deletion
  2. Changing ONLY the size (shrink)?                → scale
  3. Changing ONLY the surface material/texture?     → material
  4. Changing ONLY the hue/colour?                   → color
  5. Changing the whole object's artistic aesthetic? → global
  6. Replacing the part's shape OR swapping it
     for a logically equivalent but different object → modification

  Key distinctions:
  • modification changes WHAT the part IS or HOW it is shaped
  • material changes what it is MADE OF (substance) — geometry stays identical
  • color changes its HUE — geometry and material both stay identical
  Never mix: "a red wooden leg" = TWO edits (color + material), not one.

# RULES
  R1. selected_part_ids must only contain IDs from the part list.
  R2. No two edits may share the same edit_type AND selected_part_ids.
  R3. global edits use selected_part_ids = [].

# SEMANTIC GROUPING — applies to BOTH deletion and modification
  Two kinds of parts should be grouped into a single edit:

  (a) Repeated instances — parts sharing the same functional role that appear
      multiple times on the object:
        all four chair legs · both wheels · all fin panels · all support struts
      Clue: similar names or descriptions that differ only by position or index.

  (b) Semantic constituents — distinct parts that together form one coherent
      semantic unit, such that acting on only a subset would leave an incomplete
      or incoherent result:
        a character head → ears + eyes + nose + mouth → ONE deletion
        a human hand → fingers + palm → ONE edit
        a face panel → all facial feature parts → ONE edit
      Clue: the parts collectively define a single recognisable sub-object;
      removing or changing just one of them would produce a broken result.

  For DELETION:
  • Treat the entire group as ONE edit — list ALL member part_ids in selected_part_ids.
  • Never target the primary structural body for deletion.
  • Each deletion should be a plausible user action.

  For MODIFICATION:
  • When the same change applies uniformly to a group, list all IDs in one edit.
  • Unlike deletion, the primary structural body CAN be a modification target.

# DELETION EDITS
  edit_params must be {}. after_desc must be null.

# MODIFICATION — edit_params.new_part_desc: name the new object/shape AND key geometry.
  (a) Shape morph — same role, different geometry
  (b) Functional replacement — different object in the same structural slot
  FORBIDDEN: changing ONLY colour (→ color) or ONLY material (→ material).

# MATERIAL — target_material: specific surface substance, e.g.
  "polished walnut wood" · "brushed stainless steel" · "frosted borosilicate glass"

# COLOR — target_color: descriptive colour phrase (hue/shade only), e.g.
  "deep crimson red" · "matte charcoal black" · "cobalt blue"
  Forbidden: bare palette names — always qualify them.

# GLOBAL — target_style: choose ONLY from the "GLOBAL STYLE ROSTER" in the user message.
  Each global edit must use a style from a DIFFERENT category row of the roster.

LANGUAGE: All output fields must be in English only. Do not use any Chinese or other non-English characters.

# OUTPUT — one JSON object (no view_index — there is no image)

  "object": {
    "full_desc": "<complete English description of the object>",

INPUT (two possible layouts):
  [Non-global edits] 5×2 grid image:
      TOP row    = 5 views of the 3D object
      BOTTOM row = 5 highlight renders — selected (target) parts are RED,
                   all other parts are GREY, background is WHITE.
      Column layout:
        col 0          = the view with the HIGHEST target-part visibility
                         (computed from pixel counts)

      A single row of 5 RGB photos (no bottom row).

  • Edit instruction and edit type in text.

TASK (non-global):
  1. Locate the red region(s) in the bottom row — note their exact shape, size, and position within each column.
  2. For each column, look directly ABOVE the red region in the top-row RGB: what physical object/component occupies that exact spatial area?
     Do NOT guess from the scene context — trace the boundary carefully.
  3. Based on steps 1–2, identify what the target part actually IS (its shape, material, label).
  4. Compare the identified part against the edit instruction and target_part_desc.
     Judge alignment: does the instruction make semantic sense for that exact part?
  5. Choose which column (0–4) shows the target part most clearly for downstream editing.

TASK (global):
  1. You only see RGB photos — the whole object is the edit target.
  2. Judge alignment based on whether the edit type/instruction applies to the whole object.
  3. Choose which column (0–4) shows the overall object most clearly for editing.

RULES:
  R1. aligned=true  iff ALL of the following hold:
        • The red-highlighted parts visually match the instruction’s stated target
          (correct parts, not too many and not too few).
        • The edit type is appropriate for those parts.
        • The instruction is specific and unambiguous.
  R2. aligned=false in ANY of these cases:
        • Wrong selection — highlighted region does not correspond to the named
          target in the instruction.
        • Over-selection — far more parts are highlighted than the instruction
          refers to.
        • Under-selection — the instruction targets multiple distinct parts but
          only a subset is highlighted.
        • Fully occluded — red is absent in ALL 5 columns.
        • Unclear prompt — the instruction is so vague or self-contradictory that
          a downstream editor cannot act on it.
  R3. best_view = the column where the target is most visible in the top-row RGB
      and best suited for downstream image editing.
  R4. For global edits, always aligned=true unless the instruction is incoherent.
      Choose best_view from the RGB photos based on overall object visibility.

INPUT (images, in order):
  Image 1 = a 2x5 collage of ONE 3D object.
    TOP row    = BEFORE (5 views)
    BOTTOM row = AFTER  (5 views, same camera per column)
  Image 2 (optional) = the 2D EDIT REFERENCE: the intended appearance the AFTER
    object was conditioned on. It shows the target part as a SOLID, complete
    shape. Use it as ground truth for what the AFTER geometry SHOULD look like.
  Image 3 (optional) = the 2D INPUT: the original object before the edit.
  The user message supplies: edit_type, edit_prompt, object description,
  target part label + description, and one type-specific extra
  (new_part_desc | factor | target_material | target_color | target_style).

WHAT SHOULD CHANGE vs MUST NOT CHANGE (by edit_type):
  deletion      change: target part is REMOVED (gone in AFTER)
                keep:   ALL other parts intact; no holes, no orphan stubs.
  addition      change: target part is ADDED at its natural location
                keep:   ALL other parts intact; no duplicates, no clipping.
  modification  change: SHAPE / SILHOUETTE of target part
                keep:   colour, material, position; ALL other parts intact
  scale         change: SIZE of target part (shrinks by factor; still attached)
                keep:   shape of target part; ALL other parts intact
  material      change: SURFACE FINISH of target part (e.g. wood -> steel)
                keep:   geometry of ALL parts; colour broadly similar
  color         change: HUE / SHADE of target part

  global        change: WHOLE-OBJECT art style / rendering aesthetic
                keep:   underlying geometry + structure still recognisable

TASK:
  1. Locate the target region in BEFORE from the part label + description.
     For *addition* verify it APPEARS in AFTER; for global it is the whole object.
  2. For each column compare same-camera BEFORE vs AFTER: did "what should
     change" change, and did anything in "must not change" change?
  3. SCAN the AFTER closely for mesh damage (see MESH INTEGRITY below) and set
     artifact_free accordingly.
  4. Apply HARD_FAIL rules (R1); if any triggers, set edit_executed=false.
  5. Emit ONE JSON object per the OUTPUT schema, no prose, no fences.

MESH INTEGRITY (drives artifact_free — judge this on the AFTER geometry):
  Scan ALL 5 AFTER views CLOSELY for:
    SEE-THROUGH HOLES / punctures — a spot on a surface that should be solid
      where you can see through to the background or the part's inner back-face
      (reads as a darker cavity or a window of background colour INSIDE the
      silhouette). THIN-SHELL parts (sleeves, capes, skirts, wings) are the
      usual offenders — look hard at them and cross-check Image 2: if the
      reference shows a solid filled part but the AFTER shows a gap there, that
      is a hole.
    torn / ripped / missing-face surfaces, open shells,
    floating disconnected fragments or blobs,
    broken / shattered / collapsed structure,
    DUPLICATED / GHOST geometry (a second copy of the object or part, extra
      heads / limbs, doubled silhouette),
    jagged stubs at a deletion site, interpenetration / clipping.
  artifact_free = true ONLY if NONE of the above is present. A single clear
  see-through hole, tear, floating fragment, or ghost duplicate => artifact_free
  = false.

OUTPUT: ONE valid JSON object only. First character must be "{" and last "}".

  global        change: whole-object art style ; keep: underlying geometry recognisable

TWO INDEPENDENT AXES — score them SEPARATELY, never let one bleed into the other:
  (1) MESH INTEGRITY  -> mesh_quality [1..5]
      Is the AFTER geometry physically well-formed, IRRESPECTIVE of whether the
      edit succeeded?  Scan ALL 5 AFTER views CLOSELY (zoom into each part) for:
        SEE-THROUGH HOLES / punctures — a spot on a surface that should be solid
          where you can see through to the background or to the part's inner
          back-face (often reads as a darker cavity or a window of background
          colour inside the silhouette). THIN-SHELL parts (sleeves, capes,
          skirts, wings) are the usual offenders — look hard at them.
        torn or ripped surfaces, missing faces, open shells,
        floating disconnected fragments or blobs detached from the body,
        broken / shattered / melted / collapsed structure,
        jagged stubs left at a deletion site,
        interpenetration / clipping of one part through another.
      Cross-check against Image 2 (EDIT REFERENCE): if the reference shows the
      target part as a solid filled surface but the AFTER render shows a
      hole / gap / see-through patch there, that is a mesh defect — record it.
      mesh_quality scale:
        1 = badly broken (large holes, shattered, floating chunks, collapsed)
        2 = clearly damaged (a visible see-through hole/tear, or a detached fragment)
        3 = minor defects (small puncture or slight stub, still mostly coherent)
        4 = clean, no see-through holes, no visible defects
        5 = clean AND crisp (well-formed, solid surfaces in every view)
      A single clear see-through hole caps mesh_quality at 2.
  (2) EDIT EXECUTION  -> edit_strength [0..5]
      How much of the REQUESTED change actually happened?
        0 = AFTER target region indistinguishable from BEFORE (no attempt)
        1 = faint / partial change in the right direction
        2 = partial but clearly under-done
        3 = requested change recognisable though imperfect
        4 = change clearly and correctly applied
        5 = change fully and precisely applied per the instruction
      Be LENIENT: a recognisable, plausible attempt in the right direction
      scores >=3 even if not perfect.  Score 0 ONLY when nothing changed.

TASK:
  1. Locate the target region in BEFORE (for addition it is ABSENT in BEFORE ->
     verify it APPEARS in AFTER; for global the target is the whole object).
  2. Column by column, compare same-camera BEFORE vs AFTER.
  3. Score mesh_quality and edit_strength INDEPENDENTLY per the scales above.
  4. Judge correct_region and preserve_other.
  5. Emit ONE JSON object per the schema, no prose, no fences.

OUTPUT: ONE valid JSON object only. First character must be "{" and last "}".

RULES:
  R1. mesh_quality is judged ONLY on geometric well-formedness of AFTER, NEVER on
      whether the edit matched the instruction.  A perfectly-executed edit on a
      torn mesh still scores LOW mesh_quality; a clean mesh that barely changed
      still scores HIGH mesh_quality.
  R2. edit_strength is judged ONLY on how much of the requested change happened,
      and is NEVER penalised for mesh defects.  Do NOT hard-fail a partial edit —
      grade it.
  R3. mesh_defects lists every defect class you actually see (empty list [] if
      none).  Set artifact_free = (mesh_defects is empty AND mesh_quality >= 4).
  R4. correct_region = change localised to the named target part (global: applied
      consistently across all 5 views; deletion: removed region matches the named
      part; addition: new part at its natural attachment site, not floating).
  R5. preserve_other = every OTHER part intact in shape and position (global:
      structure + part count preserved).  Minor lighting/shading shifts are OK.
  R6. visual_quality is an overall-impression score [1..5]; secondary to
      mesh_quality and edit_strength.
  R7. edit_executed = (edit_strength >= 1).  [Kept only for schema compatibility.]
  R8. prompt_quality rates how precisely the ORIGINAL prompt matches what actually
      happened (1..5).  improved_prompt is an imperative rewrite matching the
      observed AFTER; if edit_strength == 0 write "No change observed - <diagnosis>".
